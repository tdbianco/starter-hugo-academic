Throwback of a brief talk I gave during the first lockdown (is it already two years ago?)

Here I talk of one of the projects I helped to kickstart, the [Safe Passage Follow Up](https://www.aims-2-trials.eu/our-research/biomarkers/influence-early-environment/) in Cape Town, South Africa.

I visited Cape Town and the great team made of Dr Cilla Springer, Mandy Potter, Carlie Du Plessis, Wendy Mackay and Petrusa Smit at Tygerberg Hospital in December 2018, and we set up their EEG and eye-tracker. Now they are testing, and they already capped and recorded thousands of children.
