In this final video of the series, I demonstrate running a simple mixed model in R with the function `lmer`.

This video is a step-by-step demonstration of how to run a mixed model in R with lmer, using the `sleepstudy` dataset.

Find the {{% staticref "uploads/demo.Rmd" "newtab" %}}script{{% /staticref %}} and the {{% staticref "uploads/Running-A-Mixed-Model-in-R-with-lmer.pdf" "newtab" %}}slides{{% /staticref %}} at these links. Also, here is an {{% staticref "uploads/practice.Rmd" "newtab" %}}additional script{{% /staticref %}} to practice this method on the `stroop` dataset.

Here is [the introductory talk of this series](https://tdbianco.netlify.app/post/the-hitchhiker-s-guide-to-mixed-models/), and [a demonstration of this mixed model in SPSS](https://tdbianco.netlify.app/post/running-a-mixed-model-in-spss-with-the-mixed-command/) (achieving the same output) by my colleague Mary Agyapong.

I also provided [an essential tutorial](https://tdbianco.netlify.app/post/essential-demo-of-a-multilevel-mixed-model/https://tdbianco.netlify.app/post/essential-demo-of-a-multilevel-mixed-model/) to read the output of lmer when fitting this mixed model in R.

Hope you enjoyed this series, and you will enjoy even more fitting mixed models on your data in R (and SPSS, if that fits you better).
