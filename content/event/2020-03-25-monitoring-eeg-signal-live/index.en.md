Illustrating common EEG artifacts that can be monitored and corrected while testing. 

Please note that this video was recorded in March 2020: it was the first weeks of lockdown and I had terrible connection and equipment at home, hence the quality (especially the audio) is not very good. 

And when I say not very good, I really mean **not very good**, no euphemism.
