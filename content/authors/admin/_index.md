I am a Medical Doctor and a PhD in Psychological Science and Education. After my PhD, I worked as biostatistician for a clinical trial provider in London. Now I work as senior postdoc and coordinate multi-national studies of different nature in Europe, Asia and Africa in the  field of autism and child development. I analyse eye-tracking, EEG and demographic data to to gain insights that, I hope, will contribute to improve autistic people's life. My favourite statistical methods are mixed models and  time series, such as Growth Curve Analysis. I am passionate about science, coding, writing and drawing.
