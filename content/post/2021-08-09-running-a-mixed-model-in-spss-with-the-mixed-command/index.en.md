As part of this series on Mixed Models, [Mary Agyapong](https://twitter.com/_MaryAgyapong) shared her analytic pipeline to run a mixed model in SPSS using the mixed command.

As an example, Mary used the `sleepstudy` dataset, the same used in the [Essential Demo of a Multilevel/Mixed Model](https://tdbianco.netlify.app/post/essential-demo-of-a-multilevel-mixed-model) in R.
